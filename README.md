Tomato and potato  disease classification through Convolutional Neaurl Networks(Deep learning).
The tomato dataset contains images that are divided into four classes i.e :
                                     tomato early blight
                                     tomato late blight
                                     tomato mld leaf
                                     tomato healthy
The potato dataset contains 3  classes i.e :
                                     potato early blight
                                     potato late blight
                                     potato healthy
Model uses deep learning techniques i.e  Neural Networks for classification of images.
